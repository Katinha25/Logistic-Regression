# Logistic-Regression

In this repository, I use the SUV purchase data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/rakeshrau/social-network-ads) to illustrate the steps to build a logistic regression. 

The repository includes data exploration with several plots, variable transformation, model development, and model evaluation.

The dependent or outcome variable is "Purchased" (i.e., whether or not users purchased an SUV) and the dependent variables are age, estimated salary, and gender.
